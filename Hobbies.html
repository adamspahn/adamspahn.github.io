      <div class="volleyball">
        <h3>Volley Ball</h3>
        <p>Volleyball has always been one of my all time favorite sports. Ever since I was in middle school,
        my friends would always play volleyball and I never understood what they found so fun in the sport.
        One time I tried giving it a chance and I found out that I was way better at it than I thought I would be.
        From then on I found out slowly growing on me and I started enjoying playing volleyball so much to the point
        where I joined the school's Volleyball team and played in tournaments against other schools in Bahrain. I would
        describe volleyball as one of my passions. </p>

      <div class="pingpong">
        <h3>Ping Pong</h3>
        <p>Similar to volleyball, I initially did not have an interest in pingpong. But after I tried it,
        it became a very enjoyable sport to play with friends and family. One of the reasons why pingpong was a great
        sport for me to play with friends is because a few of my friends own pingpong tables and they have them inside their
        rooms. Whenever we are bored, we go to the pingpong table and just play against each other for hours. </p>

      <div class="videogames">
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, my dad got me a ps1 and I ended up buying games for it and those were the most enjoyable
        times of my childhood. I got to dive into the digital world of video games and enjoy so many different and unique
        storymode games that had amazing background stories and I fell in love with gaming consoles. I currently switched over
        to a gaming computer because I found that It was way more efficient for me to have one because I could also do
        school and university work on it, as well as go on online voice calls with my friends and play online video games with them.</p>

      <div class="watchingshows">
        <h3>Watching Shows</h3>
        <p>Since most people aren't born with a common heart disease, most people would have hobbies that are outdoor. I on the other hand love
        activities that can be done indoor since they don't require lots of movement because I get tired and run out of breathe very easily.
        I love watching netflix shows and movies because they are a great way to entertain yourself and pass the time whenever you have freetime.
        I am currently watching a netflix show called the Big Bang Theory and it is mainly comedy. The show has 12 seasons in total, I have reached
        the 9th season, so I am very close to completing it. </p>
