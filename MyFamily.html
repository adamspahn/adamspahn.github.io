        <p>My family is a total of 4 people, these include me, my sister, my mom and my dad.
        We all live together in a house in Amwaj Islands in Bahrain. We moved into this house 6 years ago, before
        this house we were living in another area in Bahrain called Hamad Town.</p>

          <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Adam Michael Spahn and I am the eldest out of my parents children.
        I am 19 years old and there are many things to say about myself. For example, my favorite color

      <div class="mysister">
        <h3>My Sister</h3>
        <p>My sister's name is Sarah Michael Spahn and she is the youngest out of the both of us.
        Me and my sister have had a good relationship together as brother and sister ever since we
        were kids. We used to always play video games together and have movie nights and make popcorn
        and sit with my mom and dad and do fun things to pass the time.</p>

      <div class="mymom">
        <h3>My Mom</h3>
      <p>My mother's name is Haroona Salahaldin and she is the best mother a son could ever ask for.
      She has always been a huge part of my life and she is the one that raised both me and my Sister
      when we were kids. My mom always looked out for me and my sister when we were kids because my
      dad was very busy trying to work in Saudi to provide for the family.</p>

      <div class="mydad">
        <h3>My Dad</h3>
      <p>My father's name is Michael Spahn and he is also the best father a son could ask for.
      He would always tire himself working out in the sea in Saudi, he works as a manager in
      Telecommunication Engineering and whenever he would come back from work on weekends he would
      take me and my little sister to do activities such as going to the Cinema or going Go Karting. </p>
