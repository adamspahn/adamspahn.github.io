        <h3>Turkey</h3>
      
      <p>I have travelled to a couple places around the world in my life time, but
      the most beautiful place I have visited has to be Turkey. It has an amazing culture
      and so many sightseeing spots that look out of this world. Since I have lived in Bahrain
      for most of my life, It was nice to travel to this country because it snows and rains a lot there.
      When I went to Turkey, me and my family got a wonderful experience going on a tourist bus and
      viewing several different areas in Turkey. We got to go ziplinning and also hiking on the mountains
      where it was snowing, we also got to ski a little, but it was too cold to stay out for long.
      We also got to enjoy some of famous Turkish foods such as shawarmas which are made
      best in Turkey. Overall it was a month to remember because we had tons of fun and I would do it all over again.

  <div class="dubai">
    <h3>Dubai</h3>
  <p>Me and my family travelled to dubai a very long time ago. I can barely remember
  anything about this trip because it was around the time where I was 9 years old. The only
  memory I have of Dubai is us visiting Ski Dubai where we got to ski in snow that was very beautiful
  and satisfying to play with as a child.</p>

  <div class="vietnam">
    <h3>Vietnam</h3>
    <p>One of my all time favorite travelling trips!!! This was the first ever time me and my freinds
    got to travel outside of the country together at the age of 16. It was a school trip to serve the village
    communities in viatnam that were in need of help. It was an outstanding experience that made my year better than
    any of the previous years in highschool. We got to visit two different villages and stay overnight in something similar
    to a hut. We stayed up all night eating seeds and talking about life and how amazing the trip was while we were there.
    We also got to bond a lot more than I expected and I feel like everyone on that trip bonded in a way we never did before.
    We also stayed at hotels some of the nights and visited other cities and went on tours to see places in vietnam and we
    did a lot of community voluntary work which was great to help people in need.</p>

  <div class="unitedstates">
    <h3>United States</h3>
    <p>When I was younger, me and my family visited Washington D.C. quite oftenly because my dad is from there
    and his family also lives there. I got to visit my grandpa and meet him for the first time since I was born.
    I got to play wii sports with my granpa and we got to bond and get to know more about each other since I didn't
    know much about him and same thing vice versa. It was also snowing and I went out in the snow and had a snowboard with
    me and It was also the first time I got to experience snowboarding and it was really fun. Almost everyday we were there
    we went to breakfast early in the morning and had waffles and pancakes and for dinner we would go to this one place that
    had crabs and they seasoned them with something that tasted out of this world.
