    <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Adam Michael Spahn, I am 19 years old and some thing
most people probably don't know about me is that I was born with a common heart disease called
Bicuspid Aortic Valve disease that limits my ability when it comes to sports and physical activity.

  <div class="school">
    <h2>School</h2>
<p>I was previously studying at Modern Knowledge Schools and graduated with an American Diploma.
Highschool was the best time of my life because I got to see my friends and interact with so many
people but it is different now in university because everyone has responsibilities and are caught
up in work so I don't see my friends as often. The experience I had through highschool was amazing
and the work was not too difficult, so I got by pretty easily.</p>

<div class="university">
  <h2>University</h2>
<p>I am currently attending the British University of Bahrain. I am studying and majoring in
  Cyber Security and Computer Science. I am currently learning both html and css in Ms.Jissy George's class.
This will be the first ever website that I created and I am very excited about it. My hopes
for this module is that I obtain the skills to professionally build a website and design
it and also make it responsive to users that access the website.</p>

<div class="cybersecurity">
  <h2>Why I Chose Cyber Security</h2>
  <p>The reason why I chose Cyber Security as my major is because I heard that I want
  to help people keep their private information safe and I also heard from people that working
  in Cyber Security is like being a friendly hacker that protects peoples data instead of attack it.
  Hacking has always been an interesting thing to me because it is fascinating because of how
  complicated it looks. I would like to one day be able to protect companies and making their
  data safe. </p>
